	<h2>"No plans to republish"</h2>
			<p>The Education Department, asked for comment on our reporting, noted that it relies on school districts to provide <b>accurate information</b> in the survey responses and says it will update some of these data later this fall. But, officials added, the department has <b>no plans</b> to republish the existing publication.</p>

			<p>This confusion comes at a time when the need for clear data on school violence has never been more pressing. Students around the country are heading back to school this month under a cloud of fear stemming from the most recent mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Santa Fe, Texas.</p>

			<p>At least <b>53 new school safety laws</b> were passed in states in 2018. Districts are spending millions of dollars to "harden" schools with new security measures and equipment. A blue-ribbon federal school safety commission led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is holding public events around the country, including one in Alabama Tuesday. Children are spending class time on active-shooter drills and their parents are buying bulletproof backpacks.</p>

			<p>Our reporting highlights just how <b>difficult</b> it can be to track school-related shootings and how researchers, educators and policymakers are hindered by a lack of data on gun violence.</p>


		<h2>"I think someone pushed the wrong button"</h2>

	
			<p>The Civil Rights Data Collection for 2018 required every public school — <b>more than 96,000</b> — to answer questions on a wide range of issues.</p>

			<p>It asked what sounded like a simple question:</p>

	<div class="hideme">
			<div class="data">
				<h3>In the 2015-2016 school year, "Has there been <b>at least one incident</b> at your school that involved a shooting (regardless of whether anyone was hurt)?"</h3>
			</div>
	</div>

			<p>The answer — "nearly <b>240</b> schools (0.2 percent of all schools)" — was published this spring.</p>

			<p>The government's definition included any discharge of a weapon at school-sponsored events or on school buses. Even so, that would be a rate of shootings, and a level of violence, much higher than anyone else had ever found.</p>

			<p>For comparison, the Everytown for Gun Safety database, citing media reports, listed just 29 shootings at K-12 schools between mid-August 2015 and June 2016. There is little overlap between this list and the government's, with only <b>eight schools</b> appearing on both.</p>
