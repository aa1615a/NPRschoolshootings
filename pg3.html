	<h2>The Uncertainty In School Shooting Numbers: Which Number Is Right?</h2>

			<p>There is little overlap between K-12 shootings for the 2015-2016 school year listed in the Everytown for Gun Safety database, the Civil Rights Data Collection and those confirmed by NPR. Only eight incidents appear on all three lists. Of the 29 shootings listed in the Everytown database, only eight appear in the CRDC. NPR confirmed an additional three incidents that appear in the CRDC but not in the Everytown database.</p>

		<h2>"We got wind of it and nipped it in the bud"</h2>

		<div class="hideme">
			<p>In other cases, something may have happened, but not the firearm discharge the survey asked about.

			<p>The biggest discrepancy in sheer numbers was the <b>37 incidents</b> listed in the CRDC for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Roseann Canfora, the district's chief communications officer, told us that, in fact, 37 schools reported "possession of a knife or a firearm," which is the previous question on the form.

			<p>The number 37, then, was apparently entered on the <b>wrong line</b>.

			<p>Similarly, the CRDC lists four shootings among the 16 schools of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District in California. Gail Pinsker, spokeswoman for the district, says that "going back 20-plus years," <b>no one can remember</b> any incident involving a firearm. Their best guess, she says, is that there was some kind of mistake in coding, where an incident involving something like a pair of scissors (California Education Code 48915[c][2]), for example, got inflated into one involving a firearm (48915[c][1]).

	<h3>Examples of miscategorization</h3>
	<div class="hideme">
			<p>Ray Poole, the chief of legal services for the Nassau County School District in Florida, told us that at one school where a shooting was reported, Callahan Middle School, on Nov. 21, 2015, a Saturday, a student took a picture of himself at home holding a gun and posted it to social media. "We got wind of it and nipped it in the bud." No shooting.

			<p>The CRDC shows seven shootings in DeKalb County, Ga. Police reports provided to us by that district give a sense of more of the many, many ways the data collection may have gone wrong.

			<p>At Redan Middle School, there is a report of a toy cap gun fired on a school bus — not a shooting.

			<p>The CRDC shows a shooting at Stone Mountain Middle School, but a police report shows an incident at Stone Mountain High School instead.

			<p>And district officials provided a police report showing that there was a shooting after a McNair High School football game — in August 2016, after the time period covered in the survey.</p>
